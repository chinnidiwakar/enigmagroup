Adam has one more coin than Bob
So assume Adam has 2 coins, Bob has 1 coin

Possible outcomes for:
Adam: HH, HT, TH, TT
Bob: H, T

Situations wher Adam has more T than Bob:
Adam Bob Probability
HT   H   2/4 * 1/2 = 2/8
TT   H   1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8
TT   T   1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8

The sum of the probabilities is 4/8
Which can be reduced to 1/2
